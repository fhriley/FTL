# Code hardening and debugging improvements
# -fstack-protector-strong: The program will be resistant to having its stack overflowed
# -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and -O1 or higher: This causes certain unsafe glibc functions to be replaced with their safer counterparts
# -Wl,-z,relro: reduces the possible areas of memory in a program that can be used by an attacker that performs a successful memory corruption exploit
# -Wl,-z,now: When combined with RELRO above, this further reduces the regions of memory available to memory corruption attacks
# -g3: More debugging information
# -fno-omit-frame-pointer: get nicer stacktraces
# -funwind-tables: Generate static data for unwinding
# -fasynchronous-unwind-tables: Increased reliability of backtraces
# -fexceptions: Enable table-based thread cancellation
# -Wl,-z,defs: Detect and reject underlinking (phenomenon caused by missing shared library arguments when invoking the linked editor to produce another shared library)
# -Wl,-z,now: Disable lazy binding
# -Wl,-z,relro: Read-only segments after relocation

# -Wall: This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros. This also enables some language-specific warnings described in C++ Dialect Options and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options.
# -Wextra: This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall.
# -Wno-unused-parameter: Disable warning for unused parameters. For threads that don't need arguments, we still have to provide a void* args which is then unused.

# Extra warning flags we apply only to the FTL part of the code (used not for foreign code such as dnsmasq and SQLite3)
# -Werror: Halt on any warnings, useful for enforcing clean code without any warnings (we use it only for our code part)
# -Waddress: Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses
# -Wlogical-op: Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions
# -Wmissing-field-initializers: Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing
# -Woverlength-strings: Warn about string constants that are longer than the "minimum maximum length specified in the C standard
# -Wformat: Check calls to printf and scanf, etc., to make sure that the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make sense.
# -Wformat-nonliteral: If -Wformat is specified, also warn if the format string is not a string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function takes its format arguments as a va_list.
# -Wuninitialized: Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
# -Wswitch-enum: Warn whenever a switch statement has an index of enumerated type and lacks a case for one or more of the named codes of that enumeration.
# -Wshadow: Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable, parameter, type, class member, or whenever a built-in function is shadowed.
# -Wfloat-equal: Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons
# -Wpointer-arith: Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type or of "void".  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1
# -Wundef: Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an "#if" directive
# -Wbad-function-cast: Warn when a function call is cast to a non-matching type
# -Wwrite-strings: When compiling C, give string constants the type "const char[length]" so that copying the address of one into a non-"const" "char *" pointer produces a warning
# -Wparentheses: Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people often get confused about
# -Wlogical-op: Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions
# -Wstrict-prototypes: Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the argument types
# -Wmissing-prototypes: Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype declaration
# -Wredundant-decls: Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope
# -Winline: Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined
